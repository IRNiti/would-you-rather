# Would You Rather Project

## Description

This app implements a simple game where users can vote for one of two options. Once their vote is recorded, they can see how their choice compares to other users. They also have the option to create new questions. Finally, each user can see how they compare to others on the leaderboard based on how many questions they created and answered.

The login process is simplified to a dropdown with the already registered users and no authentication is required in order to login. One thing to note, users can only access the functionalities of the app after they login, otherwise they will be redirected to the login page.

This project is built with React and uses Redux for managing state. In order to run the Would You Rather App, simply clone the repo, install dependencies using `npm install` and then run it using `npm start`.
